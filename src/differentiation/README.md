B2.5 Algorithmic Differentiation documentation
======================

The source files contained in this folder are not compiled with any standard B2.5(-EIRENE) executable.
They are only needed as additional subroutines when a new version of the differentiated code is created.
The source files in tangent and adjoint folders are instead used to compile the tangent and adjoint AD codes respectively. They have been put in these subdirectories otherwise the Make file would try to use them for compilaton of standalone B2.5 or coupled B2.5-EIRENE executables.

The files with name "files_to_*.txt" are needed when differentiating the code, to tell Tapenade which source files
to keep/exclude from the differentiation.

solpsGeneralLib: file where some basic functions/subroutine not shown to Tapenade are defined, only used for differentiation

Tangent AD
-------------------------------------------

Source files differentiated in multidirectional tangent mode for standalone B2.5. To compile and run:

    $ gmake listobj depend b25_tgt
    $ b2run -tgt b2mn

The user needs to supply a "b2.optimization.parameters" file to specify wrt which input parameters the derivatives are evaluated. The tangent mode will then evaluate the derivative of all cost function wrt such parameters.

The code will automatically print in run.log the value of the cost function(s) and their derivatives.

b2mod_diffsizes.F acts similarly to b2mod_dimensions and stores the maximum number of directions (nbdirsmax) allowed, i.e. the maximum number of indpendent variables with respect to which one can calculate the derivative of the cost function. Increase nbdirsmax and recompile if needed.

Current parameters for which derivative calculation is possible (default parameters):
 - Transport coefficients: parm_dna parm_hce parm_hci parm_vsa parm_sig parm_alf
 - Radially-varying and ballooned transport coefficients: tdata b2tqna_ballooning b2tqna_ballooning_rescale
 - Boundary conditions: enepar enipar conpar mompar potpar enkpar
 - Recycling coefficients: b2recyc
 - k-model switches: keps_cd b2sikt_fac_sheath b2sikt_fac_sheath_core b2sikt_fac_diss b2sikt_fac_diss_core b2tfhi_fsigkt keps_heat keps_heat_i keps_sig keps_alf keps_visc keps_dkt keps_dzt keps_shear b2sikt_fac_vis_RS b2tfhi_fflokt b2tfhi_fconkt b2tfhi_fflozt b2tfhi_fconzt b2tfhi_fkt_hie b2tfhe_vis_kt
 - Reaction rates: rtlsa rtlra rtlcx rtlqa
 - Optimization parameters: sigma par_opt_phys

To compile and run the optimization version, for example with PETCs/TAO optimization library:

    $ game listobj depend
    $ set_tao
    $ gmake b25_tgt
    $ b2run -opt_tgt b2mn

Adjoint AD
-------------------------------------------

Source files differentiated in adjoint mode for standalone B2.5. To compile and run:

    $ gmake listobj depend b25_adj
    $ b2run -adj b2mn

By default, running this version of the code will calculate the derivative of the FIRST cost function wrt the parameters indicated in "b2.optimization.parameters".

To compile and run the optimization version, for example with PETCs/TAO optimization library:

    $ game listobj depend
    $ set_tao
    $ gmake b25_adj
    $ b2run -opt_adj b2mn
